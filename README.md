# Telomeres in breast cancer

Looking to identify parameters that would be viable for stratifying samples for prognosis. This involves investigating the association between chromothripsis and telomere length, clinical data, and mutational signatures. Telomere crisis arising from telomere dysfunction has been linked with large scale genomic rearrangements that can lead to cancer development. Hierarchical clustering from genomic data unexpectedly revealed that samples could be stratified for prognosis through 4 variables: tumour telomere length (TTL), chromothripsis status, difference between normal and tumour telomere length, and number of mutations. Subsequent predicting of these clusters through TTL, age, and NPI score revealed an indication that samples can be stratified with regard to prognosis through these variables.
